Hacking the system is more difficult than a people's thought because the information are hidden under ground. This project is still in its very early stage, but here's something I've found.

## The Goal

It is ridiculous that so many people in the world are still "doing things they don't like". Even for people "seeking their dreams", it is a pity that some of them still follow a "fashion path". This project is going to fix it.

## Resources

Maneesh Sethi has a blog called [Hack the System](http://hackthesystem.com/) that publishes related resources.

## Contribution

This project is still in its very early stage. If you are interested in giving inputs, please contact [sorpa'as plat](mailto:me@sorpaas.com) directly.
