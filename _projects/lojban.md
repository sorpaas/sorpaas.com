Here are some information of my learning and promoting Lojban. If you are just interested in the language, you can head directly to [Lojban.org](http://lojban.org).

## What is Lojban?

From [Lojban.org](http://lojban.org):

> Lojban is a carefully constructed spoken language designed in the hope of removing a large portion of the ambiguity from human communication. It was made well-known by a Scientific American article and references in science fiction Lojban has been built over five decades by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters.

Lojban has some important features that make it unique:

* Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with each other, and possibly in the future with computers.
* Lojban is designed to be culturally neutral.
* Lojban has an unambiguous grammar, which is based on the principles of logic.
* Lojban has phonetic spelling, and unambiguous resolution of sounds into words.
* Lojban is simple compared to natural languages; it is easy to learn.
* Lojban's 1300 root words can be easily combined to form a vocabulary of millions of words.
* Lojban is regular; the rules of the language are without exception.
* Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and clear thought and communication.
* Lojban has a variety of uses, ranging from the creative to the scientific, from the theoretical to the practical.

## Learning

I found many resources useful to learn Lojban:

* My original attempt to learn Lojban is through [The Lojban Reference Grammer](http://jbotcan.org/cllc/), although there are many other textbooks and articles such as [Lojban Wave Lessons](http://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=Lojban_Wave_Lessons).
* There are many translated texts such as [le cmalu noltru](http://blog.sorpaas.com/le-cmalu-noltru/).
* Many songs in Lojban are also interesting to learn, for example, [ro roi za'u re'u ji'a](http://youtu.be/qWSCCNuQPD0).

## Projects

Here are some projects I'm working on to make Lojban better:

* [lojysamtav](http://ns.mg/Lojysamtav): A Prolog-like programming language using a subset of Lojban.
* [vlajipno](http://ns.mg/Vlajipno): Full-text Dictionary for Lojban.

## Talks

I do talks about Lojban:

* Lojban: An Artificial Language at *Open Innovation Lab*.
* Lojban As An Open Source Project at *Software Freedom Day 2014*.
