Here are some words that I usually use when I'm asked to "introduce myself":

> I think if I just use one short term to describe myself, that would be "code artist". I believe in human beings and technology, and I'm also a human that loves, has fun, and enjoys freedom. I am also a Lojbanist.
>
> I build things, mostly softwares, and solve important issues, no matter big or small. I co-founded a startup called SnapViva. The startup is trying to solve a really simple problem that has been addressed many times, that it is 2014 today, and it sucks that our smartest people around the world are still trying to get users to click on advertisements. The startup has been accepted into AppWorks, which is "the Y Combinator in Asia". I have also done interns in other companies and are still working on things that I think is important.
>
> I organize events, gather like-minded people and share my visions. I did technical and non-technical speeches in Codeaholics, Open Innovation Lab, Hong Kong Code Conference and in Software Freedom Day.
>
> After all, I am myself. I am not like anyone else in the world, nor trying to become any of them.
>
> mu'o mi'e la sorpa'as
