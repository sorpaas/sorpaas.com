This is orginally posted by [Jano González](http://janogonzalez.com/2013/12/27/the-programmer-and-the-stone-statue.html), which I think is a really interesting philosophical article.

> A programmer was troubled and sad, so he went to see his Master.
>
> “Nobody recognizes my work” the programmer said with woeful voice.
>
> The Master took him to a temple with a beautiful stone statue in the center and said “If you want your work to be recognized you must be like the person who made this statue”.
>
> They kept walking for a couple of minutes util the programmer asked “Who made it?”.
>
> “I don’t know” replied the Master.
>
> Suddenly, the programmer was enlightened.
