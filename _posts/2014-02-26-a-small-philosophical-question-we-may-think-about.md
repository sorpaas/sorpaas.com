Here is a small philosophical question you may have some thoughts:

> Assume people have soul after death. You can have you own choice of going to heaven or opposite. However, you are also already selected whether you can go to heaven, which decides whether you choice is right or wrong.
>
> So that if you choose right, of course you will enjoy or pain. However if you choose wrong, then you will either lose you soul (choose to go to heaven) or get a chance to have another life (choose to go opposite)
>
> What is your choice?
