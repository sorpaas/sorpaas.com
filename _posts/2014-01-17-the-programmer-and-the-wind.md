A programmer was troubled and sad, so he went to see his Master.

"When programming, I can write comments fluently, but when it comes to code, I have trouble doing it." The programmer said in a confused voice, "I don't know what I should write."

Master opened his hands, and wind blowed over them. "The wind does not know his code either." Said the Master, "It is the comments that reminded how much code he had wrote."

Suddenly, the programmer was enlightened.
