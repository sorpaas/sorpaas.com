**SnapViva is a tool that generate advertisements.** Yes, you heard it correct. SnapViva is another tool that creates ads. To fit us in the tech categories, we are an advertisement startup, which means our potential competitors are Facebook and Google, whose employees are trying hard to get users to click on their ads. We have been working on it for over a year. So you may ask, are you guys helping the world by creating the hating ads that users and readers want to get over for decades?

That's true, but unlike others, we also want to get over ads. I still remember Jeff Hammerbacher complain about ads in the Internet years:

> The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads, that sucks.

People spent enormous amount of time working on ads, but they are still not efficient enough. We want to help them by making ads work so that those best minds can build more important things. We hate ads as they currently are as you do. However, instead of trying to block it, we treat it as a problem that has to be solved.

Companies like Google and Facebook has done great jobs on displaying ads, but they failed at the essense. **Ads are not about ads, but about delivering right information to the right user in the right way.** Ads shouldn't exist in the first place, and what we are trying to do is to put them back to the right place. **We are trying to make ads disappear by putting them back to nature.**

We started doing it by photos, and we are still building [SnapViva](http://www.snapviva.com).
