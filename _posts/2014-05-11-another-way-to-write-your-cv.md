How about a CV that can **show you yourself** but not only your work experience and education background?

---

After going to university, I started to understand the importance of CV. I can't live without it once I need to apply for jobs or interns. It is so important that although being a freshman in university, I thought I had nearly used all my times building my CV.

So many people are like me. They fill their CVs with their education background, skills and work experiences. They put their GPAs and awards if they are able to show off.

This often makes me feel stressed. Once I went by a CV with many experiences and awards or with GPAs higher than me, I started to feel envy, envy in a way that I felt I can't do anything else if I don't go to get more experience and awards for my CV.

This continues when I became an employee of a startup company, and first time in my life became a interviewer, rather than a interviewee. I asked myself and the other interviewer, "What is the most important ability we are looking for in this interview?" The answer was clear for us, the interviewee's ability to learn, to pick up new things. However, I can't find anything related to this ability in CVs, so we nearly carried out the interview regardless of their CVs.

I continued to feel uneasy of those kind of things. How HRs can filter hundreds and thousands of CVs without headache? If they just set a bottom level of GPAs or experiences, how many good employees have they missed?

I had no idea of any kind of improvement for it for a long time and continued to get more experiences and awards to fill my CVs. Until one day, after reviewing the work of my whole month, I realised that I actually did nothing but repeated work. I got bored of it, and talked to myself, "I love programming, and I defined myself as a code artist -- to write more and more useful and beautiful code continuously." **Shouldn't CV be all about this, about how you view you life, and how much progress you have made? Won't this make employers know better about us and get better ideas about our personality and abilities before the interview?**

Isn't CV supposed to **show you yourself** but not only your work experience and education background?

So I made a small improvement in my CV, to categorise them by things, rather than date and time:

> 1. Applied LISP in iOS development, and made Innohat the first company in Hong Kong that uses this techniques (Chief Engineer, Innohat).
> 2. ...

To conclude, I found writing CVs not only about your work experience and education levels, but also about how you view you life, and what you aim to do in your life.

I live in Hong Kong, a busy city, and I see many hard-working people that is not happy with their jobs. I hope more and more people in the world can do things they like (as our lucky programmers) since we are now facing less and less poverty, wars and other social issues.
