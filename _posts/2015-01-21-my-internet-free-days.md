During the new year, I had nearly one week without Internet in [Dali City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dali_City). I found it really helpful to have those days when feeling stressful or lack of ideas. Here I would like to record something I learned from it.

### The Essence of Everything

I felt fine for the first day. The weather was good, and life was good. However, I started to feel a little anxious in the second day here, because as everything settled down, you started to care about yourself, and there I found myself living all my life with computers, and did not even have many friends. So I called my old friends dating back to high school. It worked well, and it always reminds me the importance of stopping and digging out the essence.

### Ideas

One of the thing I found when being without Internet is the huge amount of ideas you could have. I realized because I was not exposed to huge amount of information any more, I can think deeper, and there was once a project called "5 days 5 topics" at that time. It turned out really well, and I learned a lot from it.

Have some Internet-free days if you could!
