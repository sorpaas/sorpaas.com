It is often that people encounter decisions that has huge impacts of their lives. Making those decisions is really difficult. I recently learned my lessions of how to deal with those things, which may be helpful.

### Figure out What Matters

It is often that a decision has many different aspects that it may influences, but for most situations, it is important to know in those aspects what matter and what not.

For example, does other people's opinions really matter? Do you really need to care about the government and economy of different countries? Is it really worth it to get influenced by what others are saying?

### Split Big One into Smaller Pieces

For example, we might split the big decisions by different conditions that may happen in the future, or split it into small steps towards a big goal.

### Discover What Makes It Hard

Find the core part that why this decision is really hard to make and ask yourself, "Is it what really matters?". Is it because money that makes it hard to make or any other things?

### Moving Forward

If it is really hard to make, it may be because you don't have sufficient information to make it. So please, gather more information, moving forward, instead of just thinking.
