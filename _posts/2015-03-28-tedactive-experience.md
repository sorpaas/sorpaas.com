I attended TEDActive 2015 this year. It was an extremely amazing experience. I want to share something I learned both from the talks and workshops, and from people that I met and talked with.

### A Church and Party

It is really not uncommon to see people [treating TED as a church](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/opinion/sunday/the-church-of-ted.html). It produces one of the best beliefs that people could ever have. In the TEDx Behind The Scene Workshop, Chris Anderson talked about what "ideas" mean in the tagline "Ideas Worth Spreading". One thing he mentioned is that an idea is not a problem, but a solution. It is not "isn't it terrible", but "isn't it interesting".

We have different topics in a TED or TEDx conference covering technology, entertainment, design and more. But the spirits of "positive ways of thinking" and "willingness of learning" are among all talks. It makes TED like a church, but really a good one, and the best one I could ever find in the world.

TED is also about people, about conversations, about learning and discussing. It is like a party, which gives like-minded people a place to meet each other, to share and understand. It is amazing to see people from more than 50 countries with different religions, cultures and political systems talking freely with each other, just like a global family.

### Ideas Inspired by Ideas

Of "Idea Worth Spreading", it is always being questioned that where those ideas will lead us to. Firstly, they inspire people. Secondly, they lead to actions, as what TEDPrize has showed us. And thirdly, from conversations around TED talks, we also know that, those ideas should lead to new ideas.

So here is what I'm trying to do: to write down some ideas that are inspired by those TED talks. If you want to add yours to the list, please [email me](mailto:me@sorpaas.com).

### Machines and Arts

Many of the attendees are artists, or at least people who care about arts and life. I learned that machines and arts work in a similar way.

As a software engineer and computer science student, I love trying out different ideas, such as some [universe simulations](http://universe.ns.mg), some [new programming languages](http://ns.mg/projects/munje.html), as well as some [tools that solve problems](https://github.com/project-nsmg/figure). I learned that artists also create their works based on ideas they find interesting, just like what Marina Abramović talked in TED this year. With those ideas, there are usually some opinions we want to express, some problems we want to solve, and some connections we want to form.

The only difference is that software engineers care about the interactions with machines, while artists care about the ones with people. And it is obvious that we are not separated in opposite sides of the world, so we should try to learn from each other.

### One Thing, Extremely Well

There are something in common I found among all attendees of TEDActive. They may not be saving the world as in Hollywood movies. Instead, they may just focus on a simple thing, but they do it extremely well.

I met Adam Ambrozewicz, who is the organizer of TEDxGdańsk. He told me many amazing things. One of them is how to recycle and reuse more so that we can produce less waste. We are aware of this environmental issue for a long time, and at the same time, we have had many TED talks about environment, recycle and plastic bags. However, even in the TEDActive conference, we still saw many unnecessary plastic bags. In contrast, what Adam has done around this issue is really awesome, he tries many ways to produce less waste and in his daily life by avoiding all unnecessary things, and reuse as much as possible. And it is now possible for him to produce no waste at all.

This is just one of the example, and those are the people that inspire me most, not about doing something big, but about doing something simple, and doing them well.

TEDActive is one of the best weeks I've had in my life. I hope I still have a chance to learn from all of you, and meet you again next year!
