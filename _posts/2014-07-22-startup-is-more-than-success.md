I can still recall the first day when I went to a startup meetup, where people just talking and making crazy stuff, boxes, lights and machines. It surprises me, because they seems just to be "having fun". And that is the first time when I got the desire to join like-minded people in startups.

I am lucky enough to finally be one of those people, one that get paid by doing what she loves. Designing, coding, deploying, and trying to control every process of the product, making it perfect. Learning about marketing, style, and all sorts of things I don't understand. In short, startup people are just "having fun".

And these kind of philosophy really gathers people. It holds an enormous community with like-minded people, people that have an ambition of their dreams. And it is our duty not to be distracted by other things other than our dreams. In another word,

> The responsibility of startups is not only to make a successful company, but also to share confidence to people with dreams to continue what they are trying to do.

It is important for us to hold the light on and encourage each other to continue make our world shining.
