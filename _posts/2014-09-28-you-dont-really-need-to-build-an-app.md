Nearly everyone has their own phones, and valuable users install apps selectively. Few people install more than a hundred apps in their phone, compared with more than millions of apps in the store.

Startups make apps, and they start to make so many of them that most of them are unnecessary. Startups should be building great business and great products, but not great apps.

Many startups have the false assumption that they need to build an app in order to *hold* users. But apps can be easily uninstalled, and it is the users that are using the app, but not that have installed the app, that create values.

Apps are expensive for users. They need to spend time installing it. Apps also take up space, and users take risks of their privacy and security.

Apps are entrance for users. They browse the Internet using apps, find their friends using apps, and text messages using apps. But if your business is not about entrance, there must be some better approaches to do it.

Apps are products. If your business only changes one part of how people do things, but you create an app together with other parts same as them in other apps, then you will spend a large amount of unnecessary time making sure those parts are just as good as other apps.

Apps has functions. They are created because they need to use cameras or other sensors on the phone. If most parts of the functions can be implemented using some hybrid things, then an app may be unnecessary.

You don't really need to build an app. For example, if you are building something that allows user to get coupons by sharing photos, you probably don't need to implement all the functions by yourself. You can watch the feed on Facebook and Twitter, and just use the API to send them the coupon they need.

If an app is not necessary, then those who do it right wins, because users love it.
