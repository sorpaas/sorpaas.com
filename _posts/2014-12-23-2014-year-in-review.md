From last year, I started to write a Year In Review post at the end of each year to record some thoughts I have about the world. As it has been the end of 2014, I decided to write another one.

### Project Nsmg
This year, I started [Project Nsmg](http://ns.mg). The progress is a bit slow because I can only work part time. The [Speech Recognition for Lojban](https://ns.mg/Speech_Recognition_for_Lojban) has gained a little attention in Lojban community and the [Reread](http://github.com/sorpaas/reread) news reader has gained 100+ stars at Github. Thanks everyone who has paied attention or contributed to those projects!

### SnapViva and AppWorks
Joining [SnapViva](http://snapviva.com) is really a fascinating experience. I am really glad to get the opportunity to go to [AppWorks](http://appworks.tw) this fall. Stay tuned and we will launch at [Lab Made](http://www.labmade.com.hk/) on Christmas.
