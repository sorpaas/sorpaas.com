Sorpa'as Personal Website
===========

This repository is forked from [GSS website](http://gridstylesheets.org/).

## Local development

Simply [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and run:

```shell
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

This will start website generation and serve the site at <http://localhost:4000>. Any file changes will cause a regeneration, and will be available on the site after a browser reload.
