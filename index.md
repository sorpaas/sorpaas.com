<p class="message">
I was not abused, abandoned, or locked up as a child. My parents were not alcoholics, nor were they ever divorced or dead. We did not live in poverty, or in misery, or in an exotic country. I am not a misunderstood genius, a former child celebrity, or the child of a celebrity. I am not a drug addict, sex addict, food addict, or recovered anything. If I indeed had a past life, I have no recollection of who I was.<br>
<br>
I have not survived against all odds.<br>
I have not lived to tell.<br>
I have not witnessed the extraordinary.<br>
<br>
This is my story.
